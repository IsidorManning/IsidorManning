### Hi!👋

# 🚀 About Me
Hello! I'm Isidor Mannig, originally from Gothenburg, Sweden, now residing in Mountain View, California. I'm currently pursuing a degree in computer science at Foothill College. If I would to describe myself breifely, I'd say that I am a highly curious individual with a passion for continuous learning.

## 📖 Background
At the age of 17, out of sheer curiosity, I delved into coding without a specific motivation. However, I quickly developed a profound love for programming. Over the past three years, my exploration of computer science has expanded to include interests in other subjects like physics and mathematics. The more I delve into each subject, the deeper my fascination grows. I myself belive my love for these subjects fundamentally stems from the joy I get of trying to understand _how_ things work in our world. 

## 💻 Programming
I love working on any types of projects that involves exploring new areas and learning new techniques. Collaborative projects is something I currently want to get into more (this is the biggest reason I started with GitHub in the first place). Working in team-driven environments ignites my enthusiasm, and I always strive to have fun while giving everything the best I can.

### Languages
Initially, I started with Python, but soon delved into frontend languages and tools like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and React.js to develop responsive and interactive UIs for my projects. Additionally, I learned C++ as part of my coursework.

## 👨‍🏫 Fun Fact
I serve as an embedded tutor in a C++ class at my college, helping students both coneptually and with hands-on coding problems. Tutoring not only allows me to help others but also deepens my understanding of the subject matter.

I'm always open to discussions, ideas, and opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me via email at isidormanning@gmail.com.

Take care!
